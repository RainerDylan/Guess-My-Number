# Guess My Number

This is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling two dice to accumulate points. The goal is to reach a set score (default: 100 points) before the opponent. The game provides hints and tracks both the current score and high score. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it delivers an interactive and engaging experience.
